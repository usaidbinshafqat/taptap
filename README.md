This is the home screen of Tap Tap, which has 5 game modes and an additional special mode which is hidden somewhere on the screen. There's also a share button which you can use to invite your friends in case you're stuck with them in traffic, on a subway or in a waiting room with other awkward people.

The interface of the 4 game modes (except level hard). The players keep the phone in the middle, which suits both their positions, and tap till they win.

The share button leads to this screen, where there are many app options to choose from (obviously depending on the ones you have saved).

This is the special game mode, known as level hard. The sizes of the buttons have been reduced, which makes it difficult for the players to tap accurately and thus slowing them down in the race.
